Single Producer Single Consumer (SPSC) prototype.

This proof of concept tester is used to test the private QRingBuffer class provided with Qt.   I use a variant of this class for pseudo real time streaming between sources and sinks in the Qt Multimedia APIs.  As demonstrated, the class is very flexible and useful.
